                    I learned to thumbnail silhouettes first, then layer in details. 
                    This helped the creature read better at game-ready sizes on screen.

                     During a Game Development course, my instructor once told us "Make a portfolio to document your work." This was followed by
                    the very enthusiastic digital hand of the student next to me as he proceeded to give us a full tour of his website. A blog 
                    spanning <b> 5 years </b> of his life working on these  mobile games, impressive right? Well, that seemed the general consensus on the 
                    zoom call. But now I can't help but wonder if he ever got recognition for such an impressive feat, the suspiciously similar 
                    “Zenith jump” to flappy bird, or that one weird game with the plastic man with the stretchy face. Though these games wouldn't 
                    get him far in popularity considering the cut throat world programming, he had a window to where he was and what he’s achieved now. 
                    This is also, for any hesitant game makers out there, exactly what you should be doing when learning  Then our instructor cut 
                    him off so we could get the hell on with learning C#.
                    
                    Before writing this first blog post, I thought, "Oh god, I really don't want to code a blog post". <br>Because I don't really
                    anything impressive to document, nothing too big happens in my life, the usual things of though, and my art, so that's what I've
                    settled on.
                    So now begs the question: how on earth am I going to consolidate all the poorly executed projects I've made and or will make 
                    into an HTML script I can barely read? Then I realised, no one's reading this. And if you are... welcome to this strange site. 
                    If I'm being honest, this terrible first impression I'm making is partly due to the fact I detest writers block,
                    and after avoiding writing anything for two weeks, I thought I might as well write SOMETHING just so I have
                    solid proof that yes- I did make a website. <em> I was here </em>
                 <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                     This is more a free form section, the polished and refined works will be found in the <em> Portfolio </em> 
                     and while it will give you access

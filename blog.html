                        During a Game Development course, my instructor once told me "Make a portfolio to document your work." This was followed by
                    the very enthusiastic digital hand of  the student next to me as he proceeded to give us a full tour of his website. A blog 
                    spanning <b> 5 years </b> of his life working on mobile games, impressive right? Well, that seemed the general consensus on the 
                    zoom call. But now I can't help but wonder if he ever got anywhere with his suspiciously 
                    
                    Before writing this first blog post, I thought, "Oh god, I really don't want to code a blog post". <br>Because I don't really
                    anything impressive to document, nothing too big happens in my life, the usual things of though, and my art, so that's what I've
                    settled on.
                    So now begs the question: how on earth am I going to consolidate all the poorly executed projects I've made and or will make 
                    into an HTML script I can barely read? Then I realised, no one's reading this. And if you are... welcome to this strange site. 
                    If I'm being honest, this terrible first impression I'm making is partly due to the fact I detest writers block,
                    and after avoiding writing anything for two weeks, I thought I might as well write SOMETHING just so I have
                    solid proof that yes- I did make a website. <em> I was here </em>
